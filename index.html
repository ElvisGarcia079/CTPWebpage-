 		Hello, my name is Elvis Garcia, and welcome to my webpage.
 		<h1>Introduction</h1>
 		<p>I have always had a deep appreciation for technology. Like a play, I enjoyed the show, but never thought about or even considered the amount of work that went on backstage. I thought technology just was; I didn't think that it was really a business with people working and coding complex algorithms using different programming languages behind the scene.</p>
 		<p>It wasn't until the Fall of 2014 that I realized, how truly powerful technology has and will become. So when I re-enrolled in school in the Spring of 2015, I declared my major in Computer Science, and was exposed to my first programming language: Python. Now, in the Fall of 2016, I have come far enough where I have attempted my first Hackathon (complete fail), and learned another programming language Java, as well as concepts like Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures. While I still have alot to learn, I think about how far I have come. I have introduced myself to the world of Mobile Development using Android Studios, and after applying to many programs for experience and getting in, I see myself entering a world that I don't know what to expect from. I am looking forward to it greatly, and my goal from all this is to secure myself a good job, that is enjoyable, and well-paid.</p>
